# CW1 Tutorial

This tutorial will take you through compiling, storing and interacting with the CW1 subkeys contract in the[ cosmwasm-plus](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-plus) repo.

`cosmwasm-plus` contains production-grade contracts, whereas `cosmwasm-examples`, which we used in the previous tutorial, is optimised for readability and for those new to CosmWasm and/or smart contracts in general.

As before, this will take four steps. Unlike before, we have more options for executing commands once instantiated:

1. Write the contract (already done)
2. Store the contract on-chain
3. Instantiate the contract
4. Execute commands using the contract:
   1. As the admin key (A), set an allowance for a key (B)
   2. As the key with an allowance, send tokens to key (C)
   3. See tokens arrive at key (C)
   4. See allowance decrease for key (B)

There is a video available that walks through the steps in this tutorial:
