# Native Asset (JUNO)

## **Token Economics (Tokenomics)**

### **Summary**

Juno Network is a completely community owned and operated smart contract platform. Therefore, the majority of the genesis supply (Over 95%) was stake-dropped to ATOM (Cosmos Hub's native asset) stakers, committed to the community pool, and committed to the development reserve for ongoing development of the Juno Network features.

✅ Initial Circulating Supply: 33.036.534 JUNO

✅ Initial Total Supply: 64.903.242 JUNO‌

✅ Maximum Supply (Reached after 12 years (2033): 185.562.268 JUNO

## Technicals

The Juno Network native asset "JUNO" is internally, ie. on the distributed ledger maintained by Validators, represented as "ujuno", which is an integer equal to 10^-6^ JUNO. Every transaction fee and reward on the network will be account for in the `ujuno` base denomination.
