# FeeShare

## x/FeeShare

The FeeShare module was [proposed in prop 51](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/51). If you’re a smart contract developer on Juno, you can now earn a cut of all gas fees generated on your contract.

If a transaction interacts with a smart contract, half of the transaction’s fees are set aside for any contract(s) a wallet has interacted with. The first 50% goes to delegators as usual (community pool), with the other 50% being split among each opted-in contract. _This opt-in requirement is only for tax purposes, it is permission-less to do_. You can opt-in and set the withdrawal contract to any other wallet, for example, a personal wallet, a DAO treasury, or a module account.\
\
These fees are paid instantly to the withdraw wallet every block (6 seconds) as interactions take place.

At this time, sub messages are not applicable to feesharing due to possible abuse. The team is working to find a solution to this use case for a future version of the module.

## Spec

You can view latest specification in the [Juno github](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno/tree/main/x/feeshare/spec). Here it describes how to register and update your contract. It also provides the details on queries, events, and different parameters which can be changed by Juno's governance system.

## Register A Contract

The `junod tx feeshare register` command allows you to register the withdrawal address for a contract. This means that any interaction fees generated by the contract will be sent to the specified address.

To use this command, you need to specify the following parameters:

* `contract_bech32`: The bech32 address of the contract whose interaction fees will be shared.
* `withdraw_bech32`: The bech32 address where the interaction fees will be sent every block.
* `--from [key]`: The name or address of the key to sign the transaction.

Note that the `withdraw_bech32` parameter cannot be set to the community pool (distribution module) address. This is because of a limitation in the way the SDK handles the module account. Additionally, for contracts created or administered by a contract factory, the withdrawal address can only be the same as the contract address. This can be registered by anyone, but it is unchangeable. This is helpful for SubDAOs or public goods to save fees in the treasury.

If you create a contract in this way, it is best to create an execution method for withdrawing fees to an account. To do this, you will need to save the withdrawal address in the contract's state before uploading a non-migratable contract.

This command can only be run by the admin of the contract. If there is no admin, then it can only be run by the contract creator.

## Update Contract Withdraw Address

The `junod tx feeshare update` command allows you to update the withdrawal address for a contract. This means that any interaction fees generated by the contract will be sent to the new specified address.

To use this command, you need to specify the following parameters:

* `contract`: The address of the contract whose withdrawal address will be updated.
* `new_withdraw_address`: The new bech32 address where the interaction fees will be sent every block.

Note that this command can only be run by the admin (if one is present) or creator of the contract. Additionally, this command cannot be used if the contract was created from or is administered by another contract (a contract factory, such as a DAO). There is currently no way for a contract to change its own withdrawal address directly in this case.

If a contract changes admin ownership, the new owner can update the withdraw address to their new wallet or DAO.

## Governance Action for FeeShare

The FeeShare module in Juno allows governance to control how transaction fees generated by contracts are distributed to their developers. The following are some of the actions that governance can take with this module:

1. Enable or Disable FeeShare Module: The `EnableFeeShare` parameter can be toggled to enable or disable all state transitions in the module. When the parameter is disabled, it will prevent any transaction fees from being distributed to contract developers, and it will disallow contract registrations, updates or cancellations.
2. Set Developer Shares Amount: The `DeveloperShares` parameter determines the percentage of transaction fees that are sent to the contract developers. Governance can set this parameter to an appropriate value to incentivize developers to create and maintain contracts on the network. **By default this is set to 50%.**
3. Define Allowed Denominations: The `AllowedDenoms` parameter is used to specify which coins are allowed to be used for transaction fees and which fees will be paid to contract developers. If this parameter is empty, all fees paid will be split among developers. If not, only fees specified here will be paid out to the withdrawal address. **Initially only JUNO token (ujuno) will be shared with developers.**

Governance can use these actions to manage the distribution of transaction fees to contract developers on the network. By incentivizing developers to create and maintain high-quality contracts, the network can attract more users and increase its overall value.
