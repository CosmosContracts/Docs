# Juno Delegations Program

The Juno Delegation Program (JDP) subDAO has been actively working on establishing fair and responsible delegation criteria for validators. This process has involved balancing various criteria to ensure the program benefits the chain and community. For the initial epoch, certain thresholds were adjusted to be more lenient, but stricter criteria will be enforced in future epochs.

Validators must meet several minimum requirements, including submission of applications, validator information, maximum commission, governance participation, and uptime, among others. Eligible validators can then earn points based on technical and non-technical criteria, with the total points determining their share of the Foundation Delegation.

The program aims to improve over time, ensuring validators are rewarded for their contributions while maintaining the health of the chain. The next epoch period will be extended to six months to allow for thorough evaluation and adjustment. The JDP is also exploring automated delegation systems for future implementation.

For detailed information on the criteria and the list of delegated validators, please refer to the full JDP document [here](https://medium.com/@JunoNetwork/juno-foundation-delegations-update-18394597059f).&#x20;
